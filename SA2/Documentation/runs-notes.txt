This file documents the scenarios run for each case study.
(It assumed you have read the techreport - sadiagnosis.pdf)

The scenario names, the input Maude files, protocols, and script files
needed to execute run_all.sh are listed here.
The scripts generate logs, events in the protocol language,
and execution deviations.  

For each case study, there is a summary.txt file that contains notes
on the diagnosis process for each scenario.

`gedanken' is run by hand according to notes in the summary.txt file

For each case study, there is a configuration.cfg file the defines
case study parameters that are not part of the protocol, but needed
to define the constraint solving problem for a scenario.

The scripts in run_all.sh are instances of the script template
described in script-notes.txt.   

The run_all.sh in each case study runs directory should be 
exected in that directory.

Note that in addition to Maude, to run the scripts requires R with
the R libraries ggplot2, ggrepel, tidyr installed with dependencies.

R does the visualization. If you don't have R, you can comment out
the lines requiring R and still get all the Maude output.

You can use the script template to make your own scenarios and script
files.
