given timelines [tl0, ... tlN]

the frontier is the set of tuples:

(i0, ... iN)

such that  iJ is less than the length of tlJ

the problem associated with (i0, ... iN) is unsat,
but any smaller tuple (pointwise) is sat.

we want to be able to compute the frontier of a log protocol pair
that is unsat.
